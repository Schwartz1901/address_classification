Database:
	data will be store in .txt files
	Insert into Trie
	Suitable Trie architecture: Methods and Attribute

Data preprocessing:
	Handle prefix: "X.", "H.", "Xm",... -> Handle many variant of prefix
	Seperator: Different variant of seperator: [",", ";", " - ", " " ] 
	Possible approach: Regex, Prefix mapping,...

Address classification:
	Data correction:	
		Case sensitive!
		Correct data for typo error
			Edit distance (need DP to optimize)
	Need tokenize???
	Ambiguity handling: Address may not contain prefix -> Dont know if it is province, district or ward yet -> need to handle it
	Prefix-trie approach?


Optimization:
	Maximum time for each request <= 0.2s
	Average time for 1 request <= 0.04s
	=> the program should finish within *(0.04 * number_of_requests)s
